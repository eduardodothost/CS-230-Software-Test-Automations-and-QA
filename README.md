Unit and Integration Testing with Junit and Maven
- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - Quality Assurance
    The liturature and popular oppinion points out that we can reduce the risk of failure by working to hash out
    the right testing metrics for our code base and team to follow through with. Being able to organize and document
    the progressive development of code in a collaborative environment ensures that the right people get to
    give feedback and correct for any failure within the projects system and design. Functionality and security are
    more likely if we can clearly identify and document the level of test coverage; and that depends on the implementation
    of testing that we choose to implement. Through quality assurance found through testing we seek to ensure that the code will be
    less likely to fail because work was done and reviewed as an effort to protect it from failure by correcting for defects and pitfalls.
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - Development Lifecycle
    Using some form of test driven development in combination with a good feedback loop between stakeholders
    can establish good vertical and horizontal movement of code. This sort of mindset has been illustrated to
    provide a good level of organization and visability and means of course correction for a project.(Graham, 2012)
- How do I approach designing software?
  So far in my studies I have realized that decoupliing well documented code to be more managable is key to collaboration
  and well structured development. I would say that I am more akin to using tools like UML diagrams and software development
  templates to be ready to describe, plot our, and document the code I write in sprints using some sort of test driven development
  in order to to progress through the development process in an agile and well prepared manner.
